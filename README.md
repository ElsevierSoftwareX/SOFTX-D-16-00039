## Goal

Duenna has been developed for enabling Text to Speech based language teaching in a very easily extensible manner. It is not restricted to a pre-recorded voice actor set of conversations, as you can easily add new sets via a simple XML interface.

## Technology

- Flash Builder 4.5
- Text to Speech using Acapela VAAS (http://www.acapela-vaas.com/)
- Fallback possibility for using pre-recorded voices

## How to compile

Duenna Online has been developed in Flash Builder 4.5. Set up an environment for FB 4.5 and you can recompile the application.
